#
# Diagnostic and debugging support for oh-my-zsh

# omz_diagnostic_dump()
#
# Author: Andrew Janke <andrew@apjanke.net>
#
# Usage:
#
# omz_diagnostic_dump [-v] [-V] [file]
#
# NOTE: This is a work in progress. Its interface and behavior are going to change,
# and probably in non-back-compatible ways.
#
# Outputs a bunch of information about the state and configuration of
# oh-my-zsh, zsh, and the user's system. This is intended to provide a
# bunch of context for diagnosing your own or a third party's problems, and to
# be suitable for posting to public bug reports.
#
# The output is human-readable and its format may change over time. It is not
# suitable for parsing. All the output is in one single file so it can be posted
# as a gist or bug comment on GitHub. GitHub doesn't support attaching tarballs
# or other files to bugs; otherwise, this would probably have an option to produce
# tarballs that contain copies of the config and customization files instead of
# catting them all in to one file.
#
# This is intended to be widely portable, and run anywhere that oh-my-zsh does.
# Feel free to report any portability issues as bugs.
#
# This is written in a defensive style so it still works (and can detect) cases when
# basic functionality like echo and which have been redefined. In particular, almost
# everything is invoked with "builtin" or "command", to work in the face of user 
# redefinitions.
#
# OPTIONS
#
# [file]   Specifies the output file. If not given, a file in the current directory
#        is selected automatically.
#
# -v    Increase the verbosity of the dump output. May be specified multiple times.
#       Verbosity levels:
#        0 - Basic info, shell state, omz configuration, git state
#        1 - (default) Adds key binding info and configuration file contents
#        2 - Adds zcompdump file contents
#
# -V    Reduce the verbosity of the dump output. May be specified multiple times.
#
# TODO:
# * Multi-file capture
# * Add automatic gist uploading
# * Consider whether to move default output file location to TMPDIR. More robust
#     but less user friendly.
