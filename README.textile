A handful of functions, auto-complete helpers, and stuff that makes you shout...

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

h2. Setup

1. Clone the repository

@git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git@

2. Symlink the zsh config with: @ln -s ~/oh-my-zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc@

3. Start / restart zsh (open a new terminal is easy enough..)

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your PATH.. and this needs to be refactored in the near future.

h2. Usage

TODO: Update this..

* Rake autocomplete: @rake (tab)@. Will generate a cache of all your rake tasks and then let you auto-complete and/or select the task to run.
* ssh autocomplete: @ssh (tab)@ or @scp (tab)@
* Git branch, it'll tell you which branch you're in when you're in a git repository directory.
* much much more..

h2. Thanks

* Rick Olsen (technoweenie) might remember some of the configuration, which I took from a pastie a few years ago.
* Whoever created the rake autocomplete stuff, which was posted all over the internet a few years ago.

h2. Help out!

If you have ideas on how to improve/optimize the configuration, don't hesitate to send pull requests.
