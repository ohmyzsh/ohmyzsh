**NOTE: This fork is specifically for Archlinux and has been patched for a system-wide install; Don't attempt to install to ~/.oh-my-zsh!! There will be a user specifc wrapper later on, but for now. system wide or use robby's official master ( not optimized for arch nor as patched; He is too lazy to merge some pull requests. )**
**This documentation/wiki isn't finished nor official!**

A handful of functions, auto-complete helpers, and stuff that makes you shout...

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

h2. Setup

@oh-my-zsh@ should work with any recent release of "zsh":http://www.zsh.org/, the minimum recommended version is 4.3.9.

h3. Installing using cower

@cower -dd oh-my-zsh-git@

h4. Enableing for a user.

The user must first have zsh set as their shell.
@[[ $SHELL == '/bin/zsh' ]] && su -c'chsh -s $(which zsh) <USERNAME>'@

For each user who wishes to use oh-my-zsh they must append/copy the user.zsh-template to their .zshrc.
@</usr/share/oh-my-zsh/templates/user.zsh-template>>$HOME/.zshrc@
If the above command doesn't run please try..
@cat /usr/share/oh-my-zsh/templates/user.zsh-template>>$HOME/.zshrc@
If that doesn't work and you don't have anything in your .zshrc file. simply copy the file accross.

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your PATH in ~/.zshrc if you're not able to find some commands after switching to _Oh My Zsh_.

h2. Usage

* enable the plugins you want in your @~/.zshrc@ (take a look at @plugins/@ to see what's possible)
** example: @plugins=(git osx ruby)@
* Theme support: Change the @ZSH_THEME@ environment variable in @~/.zshrc@.
** Take a look at the "current themes":https://wiki.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/themes that come bundled with _Oh My Zsh_.
* much much more...  take a look at @lib/@ what _Oh My Zsh_ offers...

h2. Useful

the "refcard":http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf is pretty tasty for tips.

h3. Customization

If you want to override any of the default behavior, just add a new file (ending in @.zsh@) into the @custom/@ directory.
If you have many functions which go good together you can put them as a *.plugin.zsh file in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and then enable this plugin.
If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with oh-my-zsh, create a plugin of the same name in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in @plugins/@.


h3. Uninstalling

If you want to uninstall it, just run @uninstall_oh_my_zsh@ from the command line and it'll remove itself and revert you to bash (or your previous zsh config).

h2. Help out!

I'm far from being a zsh-expert and suspect there are many ways to improve. If you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!

h3. Send us your theme!

I'm hoping to collect a bunch of themes for our command prompts. You can see existing ones in the @themes/@ directory.

h2. Contributors

This project wouldn't exist without all of our awesome users and contributors.
