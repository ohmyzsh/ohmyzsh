A handful of functions, auto-complete helpers, and stuff that makes you shout...

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

h2. Setup

1. Clone the repository

  @git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git@

2. Symlink the zsh config with:

  @ln -s ~/oh-my-zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc@

3. Set zsh as your default shell:

  @chsh -s /bin/zsh@

4. Start / restart zsh (open a new terminal is easy enough..)

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your PATH in ~/.zshrc if you're not able to find some commands after switching to oh-my-zsh.

h2. Usage

TODO: Update this..

* Rake autocomplete: @rake (tab)@. Will generate a cache of all your rake tasks and then let you auto-complete and/or select the task to run.
* ssh autocomplete: @ssh (tab)@ or @scp (tab)@
* Git branch, it'll tell you which branch you're in when you're in a git repository directory.
* much much more..

h2. Thanks

* Rick Olsen (technoweenie) might remember some of the configuration, which I took from a pastie a few years ago.
* Whoever created the rake autocomplete stuff, which was posted all over the internet a few years ago.

h2. Help out!

I'm far from being a zsh-expert and suspect there are many ways to improve. If you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!
