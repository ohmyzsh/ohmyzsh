# genpass

This plugin provides three unique password generators for ZSH. Each generator
has at least a 128-bit security margin and generates passwords from the
cryptographically secure `/dev/urandom`. Each generator can also take an
optional numeric argument to generate multiple passwords.

To use it from an interactive ZSH, add `genpass` to the plugins array in your
zshrc file:

    plugins=(... genpass)

You can also invoke password generators directly (they are implemented as
standalone executable files), which can be handy when you need to generate
passwords in a script:

    ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/genpass/genpass-apple 3

## genpass-apple

Generates a pronounceable pseudoword passphrase of the "cvccvc" consonant/vowel
syntax, inspired by [Apple's iCloud Keychain password generator][1]. Each
password has exactly 1 digit placed at the edge of a "word" and exactly 1
capital letter to satisfy most password security requirements.

## genpass-monkey

base32][2].

## genpass-xkcd

Generates passphrases from `/usr/share/dict/words` inspired by the [famous (and
slightly misleading) XKCD comic][3]. Each passphrase is prepended with a digit
showing the number of words in the passphrase to adhere to password security
requirements that require digits. Each word is 6 characters or less.
