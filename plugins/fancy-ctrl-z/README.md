# Use Ctrl-Z to switch back to Vim

I frequently need to execute random command in my shell. To achieve it I pause 
Vim by pressing Ctrl-z, type command and press fg<Enter> to switch back to Vim.
The fg part really hurt sme. I just wanted to hit Ctrl-z once again to get back 
to Vim. I could not find a solution, so I developed one on my own that 
works wonderfully with ZSH
