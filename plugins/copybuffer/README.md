# `copybuffer` plugin

This plugin adds the <kbd>ctrl-o</kbd> keyboard shortcut to copy the current text
in the command line to the system clipboard.

This is useful if you type a command - and before you hit enter to execute it - want
to copy it maybe so you can paste it into a script, gist or whatnot.

```zsh
plugins=(... copybuffer)
```
