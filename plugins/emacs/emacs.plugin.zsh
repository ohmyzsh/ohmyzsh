# Emacs 23 daemon capability is a killing feature.
# One emacs process handles all your frames whether
# you use a frame opened in a terminal via a ssh connection or X frames
# opened on the same host.

# Benefits are multiple
# - You don't have the cost of starting Emacs all the time anymore
# - Opening a file is as fast as Emacs does not have anything else to do.
# - You can share opened buffered across opened frames.
# - Configuration changes made at runtime are applied to all frames.
