## Oh My Zsh Distribution Notes

What you are looking at now is Oh My Zsh's repackaging of zsh-history-substring-search as an OMZ module inside
the Oh My Zsh distribution.

The upstream repo, zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search, can be found on GitHub at
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search.

Everything above this section is a copy of the original upstream's README, so things may differ slightly when
you're using this inside OMZ. In particular, you do not need to set up key bindings for the up and down arrows
yourself in `~/.zshrc`; the OMZ plugin does that for you. You may still want to set up additional emacs- or
vi-specific bindings as mentioned above.
