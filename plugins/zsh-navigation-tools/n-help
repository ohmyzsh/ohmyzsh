${h2}Ctrl-O, ${h2}o${rst} - enter uniq mode (no duplicate lines)
${h2}Ctrl-E, ${h2}e${rst} - edit private history (when in private history view)
${h2}F1${rst} - (in n-history) - switch view
${h2}F2${rst}, ${h2}Ctrl-X${rst}, ${h2}Ctrl-/${rst} - search predefined keywords (defined in config files)

${h1}Configuration files${rst}

Location of the files is ${h3}~/.config/znt${rst}. Skeletons are copied there
when using ${h3}zsh-navigation-tools.plugin.zsh${rst} file (sourcing it or using
a plugin manager). There's a main config file ${h3}n-list.conf${rst} and files
for each tool.

To have a skeleton copied again into ${h3}~/.config/znt${rst}, delete it from
there and restart Zsh a few times (3-7 or so; there's a random check
that optimizes startup time).

${h1}Predefined search keywords${rst}

Following block of code in e.g. ${h3}~/.config/znt/n-history.conf${rst} defines
set of keywords that can be invoked (i.e. searched for) via ${h2}F2${rst}, ${h2}Ctrl-X${rst}
or ${h2}Ctrl-/${rst}:

    ${h4}# Search keywords, iterated with F2 or Ctrl-X or Ctrl-/${rst}
    ${h2}local${rst} -a keywords
    keywords=( ${h2}\"git\" \"vim\" \"mplayer\"${rst} )

${h1}Search query rotation${rst}

When searching, after pressing ${h2}Ctrl-A${rst}, words 1 2 3 will become 3 1 2, etc.
This can be used to edit some not-last word.

${h1}Fix mode${rst}

Approximate matching - pressing ${h2}f${rst} or ${h2}Ctrl-F${rst} will enter "FIX" mode, in which
1 or 2 errors are allowed in what's searched. This utilizes original Zsh
approximate matching features and is intended to be used after entering
search query, when a typo is discovered.

${h1}Color themes${rst}

Following block of code in ${h3}~/.config/znt/n-list.conf${rst} defines set of
themes that can be browsed with ${h2}Ctrl-T${rst} and ${h2}Ctrl-G${rst}:

    ${h4}# Combinations of colors to try out with Ctrl-T and Ctrl-G
    # The last number is the bold option, 0 or 1${rst}
    ${h2}local${rst} -a themes
    themes=( ${h2}\"white/black/1\" \"green/black/0\" \"green/black/1\"${rst}
             ${h2}\"white/blue/0\" \"white/blue/1\" \"magenta/black/0\"${rst}
             ${h2}\"magenta/black/1\"${rst} )

It's \"foreground/background/bold\". There's support for 256-color themes
for Zsh > 5.2, defined like e.g.: 

    themes=( ${h2}\"white/17/0\" \"10/17/1\" \"white/24/1\"${rst} )

i.e. with use of numbers, from 0 to 254.

${h1}Private history${rst}

N-history stores what's selected in its own history file. It can be
edited. Use ${h2}e${rst} or ${h2}Ctrl-E${rst} for that when in n-history. Your \$EDITOR will
start. This is a way to have handy set of bookmarks prepared in private
history's file.

Private history is instantly shared among sessions.

${h1}Zshrc integration${rst}

There are 5 standard configuration variables that can be set in zshrc:

${h4}znt_history_active_text${rst}
\"underline\" or \"reverse\" - how should be active element highlighted
${h4}znt_history_nlist_coloring_pattern${rst}
Pattern that can be used to colorize elements
${h4}znt_history_nlist_coloring_color${rst}
Color with which to colorize via the pattern
${h4}znt_history_nlist_coloring_match_multiple${rst}
Should multiple matches be colorized (${h2}\"0\"${rst} or ${h2}\"1\"${rst})
${h4}znt_history_keywords ${h2}(array)${rst}
Search keywords activated with Ctrl-X, F2, Ctrl-/, e.g. ( ${h2}\"git\"${rst} ${h2}\"vim\"${rst} )

Above variables will work for n-history tool. For other tools, change
\"_history_\" to e.g. \"_cd_\", for the n-cd tool. The same works for
all 8 tools.

Common configuration of the tools uses variables with \"_list_\" in them:

${h4}znt_list_bold${rst}
Should draw text in bold (${h2}\"0\"${rst} or ${h2}\"1\"${rst})
${h4}znt_list_colorpair${rst}
Main pair of colors to be used, e.g ${h2}\"green/black\"${rst}
${h4}znt_list_border${rst}
Should draw borders around windows (${h2}\"0\"${rst} or ${h2}\"1\"${rst})
${h4}znt_list_themes ${h2}(array)${rst}
List of themes to try out with Ctrl-T, e.g. ( ${h2}\"white/black/1\"${rst}
${h2}\"green/black/0\"${rst} )
${h4}znt_list_instant_select${rst}
Should pressing enter in search mode leave tool (${h2}\"0\"${rst} or ${h2}\"1\"${rst})

If you used ZNT before v2.1.12 then remove old configuration files
${h3}~/.config/znt/*.conf${rst} so that ZNT can update them to the latest versions
that support integration with Zshrc. If you used installer then run it
again (after the remove of configuration files), that is not needed when
using as plugin.
