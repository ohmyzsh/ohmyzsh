CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF ZNT
-------------------------------------

Changes from 2.2.1 to 2.2.7
---------------------------

Tmux integration has been added â€“ bind file znt-tmux.zsh in Tmux as
described in README.md and e.g. run local history on remote hosts. Tmux
opens new window with n-history, and pastes selected history entry into
immediate previous window (e.g. a remote session). Fixed plugin.zsh file
to not use (outer scope) positional parameters. This fixes problem with
Grlm's Zsh configuration. The file now doesn't use "test" builtin (but
[[ instead), because it can be shadowed by alias or command. Private
history has been fixed to not overwrite its history file with the same
content. This improves performance when switching to private history
view.
