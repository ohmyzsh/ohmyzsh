# nvm plugin

This plugin adds autocompletions for [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) â€” a Node.js version manager.
It also automatically sources nvm, so you don't need to do it manually in your `.zshrc`.

To use it, add `nvm` to the plugins array of your zshrc file:
```zsh
plugins=(... nvm)
```
