# HTTPie plugin

This plugin adds completion for [HTTPie](https://httpie.org), a command line HTTP
client, a friendlier cURL replacement.

To use it, add `httpie` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... httpie)
```

It uses completion from [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions).
