# Hanami Plugin #
This plugin adds convenient ways to work with [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/) via console.
It's inspired by Rails plugin, so if you've used it, you'll feel like home.

## Usage ##

For example, type `hc` into your console when you're within Hanami project directory to run
the application console. Have a look at available shortcuts below. You can read more about
these commands [on the official website](https://hanamirb.org/guides/command-line/applications/).
