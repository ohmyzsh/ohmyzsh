# taskwarrior

This plugin adds smart tab completion for [TaskWarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/).
It uses the zsh tab completion script (`_task`) shipped with TaskWarrior for the
completion definitions.

The latest version pulled in from the official project is of January 1st, 2015.


## Examples

Typing `task [TAB]` will give you a list of commands, `task 66[TAB]` shows a
list of available modifications for that task, etcetera.
