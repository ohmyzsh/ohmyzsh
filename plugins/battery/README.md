# Battery Plugin

This plugin adds some functions you can use to display battery information in your custom theme.

To use, add `battery` to the list of plugins in your `.zshrc` file:

`plugins=(... battery)`

Then, add the `battery_pct_prompt` function to your custom theme. For example:

```zsh
RPROMPT='$(battery_pct_prompt) ...'
```

Also, you set the `BATTERY_CHARGING` variable to your favor.
For example:

```zsh
BATTERY_CHARGING="⚡️"
```

You can see the power of your charger using the following setting (MacOS only)

```zsh
BATTERY_SHOW_WATTS=true
```
