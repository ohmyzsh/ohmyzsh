# pip plugin

This plugin adds completion for [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/),
the Python package manager.

To use it, add `pip` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... pip)
```

## pip cache

The pip plugin caches the names of available pip packages from the PyPI index.
To trigger the caching process, try to complete `pip install`,
or you can run `zsh-pip-cache-packages` directly.

To reset the cache, run `zsh-pip-clear-cache` and it will be rebuilt next
the next time you autocomplete `pip install`.
