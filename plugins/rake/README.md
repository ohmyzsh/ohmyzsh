# Rake plugin

This plugin adds support for [rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), the Ruby
build tool or Ruby Make.

To use it, add `rake` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... rake)
```

## Aliases

The plugin aliases the rake command so you can pass arguments when invoking rake tasks
without having to escape the brackets, i.e., you can run

```sh
rake namespace:task['argument']
```

instead of having to do

```sh
rake namespace:task\['argument'\]
```

| Alias      | Command                        | Description                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `rake`     | `noglob rake`                  | Allows unescaped square brackets              |
| `bin/rake` | `noglob bin/rake`              | Same as above but using rake binstub          |
| `brake`    | `noglob bundle exec rake`      | Same as above but call rake using bundler     |
| `srake`    | `noglob sudo rake`             | Same as rake but using sudo                   |
| `sbrake`   | `noglob sudo bundle exec rake` | Same as above but using both sudo and bundler |

## Jim Weirich

The plugin also aliases `rake` to [`jimweirich`](https://github.com/jimweirich), author of Rake
and big time contributor to the Ruby open source community. He passed away in 2014:
