# command-not-found plugin

This plugin uses the command-not-found package for zsh to provide suggested packages to be installed if a command cannot be found.

To use it, add `command-not-found` to the plugins array of your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... command-not-found)
```

An example of how this plugin works in Ubuntu:
```
$ mutt
The program 'mutt' can be found in the following packages:
 * mutt
 * mutt-kz
 * mutt-patched
Try: sudo apt install <selected package>
```
