# Code from Mikael Magnusson: https://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2011/msg00367.html
#
# Requires xterm, urxvt, iTerm2 or any other terminal that supports bracketed
# paste mode as documented: https://www.xfree86.org/current/ctlseqs.html

# create a new keymap to use while pasting
bindkey -N paste
# make everything in this keymap call our custom widget
bindkey -R -M paste "^@"-"\M-^?" paste-insert
# these are the codes sent around the pasted text in bracketed
# paste mode.
# do the first one with both -M viins and -M vicmd in vi mode
bindkey '^[[200~' _start_paste
bindkey -M paste '^[[201~' _end_paste
# insert newlines rather than carriage returns when pasting newlines
bindkey -M paste -s '^M' '^J'
