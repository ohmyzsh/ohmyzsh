# extract plugin

This plugin defines a function called `extract` that extracts the archive file
you pass it, and it supports a wide variety of archive filetypes.

This way you don't have to know what specific command extracts a file, you just
do `extract <filename>` and the function takes care of the rest.

To use it, add `extract` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... extract)
```
