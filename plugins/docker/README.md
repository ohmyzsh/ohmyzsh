# Docker plugin

This plugin adds auto-completion and aliases for [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

To use it add `docker` to the plugins array in your zshrc file.

```zsh
plugins=(... docker)
```

A copy of the completion script from the docker/cli git repo:
https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/master/contrib/completion/zsh/_docker

## Settings

By default, the completion doesn't allow option-stacking, meaning if you try to complete
`docker run -it <TAB>` it won't work, because you're _stacking_ the `-i` and `-t` options.

[You can enable it](https://github.com/docker/cli/commit/b10fb43048) by **adding the lines below to your zshrc
file**, but be aware of the side effects:

> This enables Zsh to understand commands like `docker run -it ubuntu`. However, by enabling this, this also
> makes Zsh complete `docker run -u<tab>` with `docker run -uapprox` which is not valid. The users have to put
> the space or the equal sign themselves before trying to complete.
>
> Therefore, this behavior is disabled by default. To enable it:
>
> ```sh
> zstyle ':completion:*:*:docker:*' option-stacking yes
> zstyle ':completion:*:*:docker-*:*' option-stacking yes
> ```

### Use old-style completion

If the current completion does not work well for you, you can enable legacy completion instead with the
following setting. See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/11789 for more information.

```zsh
zstyle ':omz:plugins:docker' legacy-completion yes
```

### For Podman's Docker wrapper users

If you use Podman's Docker wrapper, you need to enable legacy completion. See above section.
