## Installation

1. Install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) by following its [installation instruction](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation).

2. Add `zsh-interactive-cd` to your plugin list in `~/.zshrc`:

   ```zsh
   plugins=(... zsh-interactive-cd)
   ```

## Usage

Press tab for completion as usual, it'll launch fzf automatically. Check fzf’s [readme](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#search-syntax) for more search syntax usage.

## Configuration

Set `zic_accept_last=true` in your `~/.zshrc` to have fzf automatically accept the last remaining match once the list is filtered down to a single directory:

```zsh
zic_accept_last=true
```
