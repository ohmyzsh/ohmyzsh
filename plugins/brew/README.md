# brew plugin

The plugin adds several aliases for common [brew](https://brew.sh) commands.

To use it, add `brew` to the plugins array of your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... brew)
```

## Shellenv

If `brew` is not found in the PATH, this plugin will attempt to find it in common locations, and execute
`brew shellenv` to set the environment appropriately. This plugin will also export
`HOMEBREW_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix)"` if not previously defined for convenience.

In case you installed `brew` in a non-common location, you can still set `BREW_LOCATION` variable pointing to
the `brew` binary before sourcing `oh-my-zsh.sh` and it'll set up the environment.

## Completion

This plugin configures paths with Homebrew's completion functions automatically, so you don't need to do it
manually. See: https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion#configuring-completions-in-zsh.

With the release of Homebrew 1.0, they decided to bundle the zsh completion as part of the brew installation,
so we no longer ship it with the brew plugin; now it only has brew aliases. If you find that brew completion
no longer works, make sure you have your Homebrew installation fully up to date.
