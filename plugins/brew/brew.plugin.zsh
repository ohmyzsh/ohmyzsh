		  With the advent of their 1.0 release, Homebrew has decided to bundle
		  the zsh completion as part of the brew installation, so we no longer
		  ship it with the brew plugin; now it only has brew aliases.

		  If you find that brew completion no longer works, make sure you have
		  your Homebrew installation fully up to date.

		  You will only see this message once.
