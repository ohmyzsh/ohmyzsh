per-directory-history plugin
----------------------------

This plugin adds per-directory history for zsh, as well as a global history,
and the ability to toggle between them with a keyboard shortcut. This is a
bundle of the [official plugin by @jimhester][5].

To use it, add `per-directory-history` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... per-directory-history)
```

This is an implementation of per-directory history for zsh, some implementations
of which exist in bash[1][],[2][]. It also implements a toggle-history function
to change from using the directory history to using the global history. In both
cases the history is always saved to both the global history and the directory
history, so the toggle state will not effect the saved histories. Being able to
switch between global and directory histories on the fly is a novel feature.

## Usage

The default mode is per directory history, interact with your history as normal.

Press ^G (the <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>G</kbd> keys simultaneously) to toggle
between local and global histories. If you would prefer a different shortcut to
toggle set the `PER_DIRECTORY_HISTORY_TOGGLE` environment variable.

## Configuration

* `HISTORY_BASE` is a global variable that defines the base directory in which the
  directory histories are stored (default `$HOME/.directory_history`).
* `per-directory-history-toggle-history` is the function to toggle between local
  and global histories.
* `PER_DIRECTORY_HISTORY_TOGGLE` is the key binding used to run the toggle-history
  function above (default `^G`)

## History

The idea/inspiration for a per directory history is from [Stewart MacArthur][1]
and [Dieter][2], the implementation idea is from [Bart Schaefer][3]. The
implementation is by [Jim Hester][4] in September 2012.
